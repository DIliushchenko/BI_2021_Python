# Tutotrial of functions

## Platform

All testes were completed using **Ubuntu 20.04** and **Python 3.9**.


## Description

* wc.py - count information in input file or stdin, has several arguments: 1. l - count of line 2. w - count of words 3. c - count of bytes that storages in machine
* ls.py - shows unhidden folders and files in directory. You can use argument '-a' to look at hidden files also. Important thing! For correct working of script you must use argument first, if it is necesseary. 
* sort.py - sorting file or input by the lines. Has no arguments

## Usage

To run all these functions use `./script.py --options -file`. Additional libraries don't required. At this project we use only **os**, **sys** and **argparse** libraries.

### Use wisely!
